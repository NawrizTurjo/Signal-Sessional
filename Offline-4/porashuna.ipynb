    "# **Why Does Filtering Not Affect Distance and Lag Calculation?**\n",
    "\n",
    "In your code, the cross-correlation between the filtered and unfiltered signals seems to produce the **same sample lag and distance**, even though you're applying a low-pass filter. Here's a detailed theoretical explanation of why filtering may not significantly affect the lag and distance calculation:\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **1. Cross-Correlation Measures Time Shift, Not Frequency Content**\n",
    "\n",
    "Cross-correlation measures the **similarity** between two signals as a function of their relative time shift (lag). Mathematically, the cross-correlation function $ R_{xy}[k] $ between two discrete signals $ x[n] $ and $ y[n] $ is defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\n",
    "R_{xy}[k] = \\sum_{n} x[n] \\cdot y[n + k]\n",
    "$\n",
    "\n",
    "The result is a function that peaks at the lag $ k $ where the two signals are most similar in terms of time shift.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Key Insight:**\n",
    "- **Cross-correlation primarily focuses on the time-domain alignment** of signals and is less sensitive to the specific frequency content, as long as the overall shape and structure of the signals remain intact.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2. Filtering and Time Shift Invariance**\n",
    "\n",
    "A low-pass filter removes high-frequency components from the signal, which affects the **frequency content** but does not significantly alter the **time shift (lag)** between the signals. This happens due to the following reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Low-Frequency Components Determine Lag:**  \n",
    "  Most of the energy in a typical signal is often concentrated in the low-frequency components. These low frequencies dominate the cross-correlation calculation and contribute significantly to determining the lag.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **High-Frequency Noise is Uncorrelated:**  \n",
    "  High-frequency noise may be present in both signals, but it is often uncorrelated or random. Therefore, removing this noise via filtering does not change the peak location of the cross-correlation function, which is primarily determined by the low-frequency (correlated) components.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Example:**\n",
    "Letâ€™s say your original signals $ A $ and $ B $ contain both:\n",
    "- A dominant sinusoidal component (low frequency, e.g., 5 Hz).\n",
    "- High-frequency noise (e.g., 20 Hz or above).\n",
    "\n",
    "Even after filtering out the high-frequency noise, the lag (shift) is determined by the 5 Hz component, which remains unchanged.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **3. Effect of Filtering on Signal Amplitude, Not Lag**\n",
    "\n",
    "Filtering affects the **amplitude** and **shape** of the signals but not the **relative time shift** between them:\n",
    "- The amplitude of the cross-correlation peak may change because filtering reduces the energy in the signals.\n",
    "- However, the **location of the peak** remains unchanged as long as the primary (low-frequency) components determining the lag are still present.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **4. Mathematical Perspective Using DFT**\n",
    "\n",
    "In the frequency domain, the cross-correlation of two signals $ x[n] $ and $ y[n] $ is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\n",
    "R_{xy}(f) = X(f) \\cdot Y^*(f)\n",
    "$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $ X(f) $ and $ Y(f) $ are the DFTs of the signals, and $ Y^*(f) $ is the complex conjugate of $ Y(f) $.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Filtering alters the magnitude of $ X(f) $ and $ Y(f) $, but not the phase information.**\n",
    "- The **phase difference** between the two signals is what determines the time shift, and since the low-frequency phase information is preserved after filtering, the lag remains unaffected.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **5. When Filtering Might Affect Lag Detection**\n",
    "\n",
    "There are scenarios where filtering can affect lag detection:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **If the Lag is Determined by High-Frequency Components**:  \n",
    "   If the correlation or delay between the two signals is driven by high-frequency features (e.g., sharp pulses or edges), applying a low-pass filter might smooth out those features and shift the lag.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Severe Attenuation of Relevant Frequencies**:  \n",
    "   If the filter cutoff is too low and attenuates even the important low-frequency components, the correlation peak might shift or disappear.\n",
    "\n",
    "In your case:\n",
    "- The lag and distance calculation are unaffected because the **dominant low-frequency components** in the signal still determine the lag, and these components are preserved by the low-pass filter.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Conclusion**\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary:\n",
    "- The **low-pass filter** affects the frequency content and reduces noise but does not alter the **time-domain lag** because the lag is determined by the preserved low-frequency components.\n",
    "- As a result, the sample lag and estimated distance remain the same after filtering, as the essential time shift information is still present in the filtered signals.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you need the lag or distance to change based on filtering, you'd need to ensure that the filtered-out frequencies contain critical information related to the shift."

    "#### a) **Effect on Signals:**\n",

    "- **Before Filtering:**\n",
    "  - The noisy signal `signal_B` contains multiple frequency components: \n",
    "    1. The **original low-frequency signal** (dominant component).\n",
    "    2. Superimposed **high-frequency noise** (from `noise_freqs2`).\n",
